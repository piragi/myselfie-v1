# Compiler Assignments

## The following information is shared via the course's slack channel.

- Lectures and tutorials
- Recordings
- Submitting homework
- Class schedule

## Important:

Always submit something for each assignment by the due date and time, even if you have not done anything. In that case, your self-grade is 5. If you fail to submit anything on time you will be failed (unless you provide proof of a medical or family emergency in a DM to me, no email please!).

## Essential for every assignment

Use the autograder to determine your grade. See the autograder's [README.md](../grader/README.md) for instructions.

> No compiler warnings, please!

## Assignment `print-your-name`:

Modify **selfie.c** such that selfie prints your name right after initialization.
Part of the assignment is to figure out how to do that.

- Do not modify any files other than **selfie.c**.
- Use the `print-your-name` target in the grader to determine your grade.

**Hint**: see [output_processing.py](../grader/lib/output_processing.py)

Your message has to be prefixed like every other "status message" of selfie.
So instead of printing:

`This is <firstname> <lastname>'s Selfie!`, you have to print `<selfie-path>: This is <firstname> <lastname>'s Selfie!`



## Assignment `hex-literal`:

Implement support of hexadecimal integer literals.

- Before coding, extend the C\* grammar with hexadecimal integer literals.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `hex-literal` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `bitwise-shift-compilation`:

Implement support of bitwise shift operators `<<` and `>>` in C\*.

- Before coding, extend the C\* grammar such that both operators have proper precedence as in C.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `bitwise-shift-compilation` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `bitwise-shift-execution`:

Implement code generation for bitwise shift operators `<<` and `>>` in C\* and support of bitwise shift instructions `sll` and `srl` in RISC-U using `<<` and `>>`, respectively.

- Before coding, extend the RISC-U ISA in **riscu.md** with `sll` and `srl` assembly and semantics.
- Do not modify any files other than **riscu.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `bitwise-shift-execution` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `bitwise-and-or-not`:

Implement code generation for bitwise logical operators `&`, `|`, and `~` in C\* and support of bitwise logical instructions `and`, `or`, and `xori` in RISC-U using `&`, `|`, and `~`.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** with `&`, `|`, and `~` and the RISC-U ISA in **riscu.md** with `and`, `or`, and `xori` assembly and semantics.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md**, **riscu.md**, and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `bitwise-and-or-not` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `array`:

Implement support of and code generation for one-dimensional arrays in C\* with the symbols `[` and `]`.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** to include `[` and `]`.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `array` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `array-multidimensional`:

Implement support of and code generation for multi-dimensional arrays in C\* with the symbols `[` and `]`.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** to include `[` and `]`.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `array-multidimensional` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `struct-declaration`:

Implement support of and code generation for `struct` declarations in C\* including internal representation of structs in the symbol table.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** accordingly.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `struct-declaration` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `struct-execution`:

Implement support of and code generation for `struct` access in C\*.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** accordingly.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `struct-execution` target in the grader to determine your grade.



## Assignment `for-loop`:

Implement support of and code generation for `for` loops in C\*.

- Before coding, extend the grammar in **grammar.md** accordingly.
- Do not modify any files other than **grammar.md** and **selfie.c**.
- Use the `for-loop` target in the grader to determine your grade.
